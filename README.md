Aim of the project 
A remote-controlled vehicle is any mobile machine controlled by means that are physically not connected with the origin external to the machine. 
In this project, we make use of Bluetooth technology to control our machine car. We do not call this a robot as this device does not have any sensors. 
Thereby, senseless robots are machines. The project aims are to design a Bluetooth control Arduino car and write a program into the Arduino microprocessor. 
Arduino car contains an Arduino microcontroller with basic mobility features. In this project, we make use of Bluetooth technology to control our machine car.

The use of the project
Bluetooth Control cars can be a helping hand for the cripples, or for the ones who want to drive but are unable due to many physical inabilities, where human life is at risk, we can use it from a very distance as it is fully wireless.

Project overview
Wireless  control  is  one  of  the most important basic needs for all people all over the world. Bluetooth is one of the most used wireless technologies. 
A Bluetooth control car is such a car that  can  be  controlled  wirelessly  using  a  Bluetooth  control  system  and  Arduino.  With  the combination of Arduino, and Bluetooth we can control many other things, like home Lighting, air conditioners, and many more  through our  cell phones. The Arduino can  also contribute  at 
large to the Smart Home system. Nowadays it has made us easier to convert digital signals into physical movements with such microcontrollers.  

Today people are using autonomation in every sector. There are many benefits, for example, it reduces the risk of injury, it is fast, it can work day long, it is reliable, etc. This Bluetooth control car is just an example of autonomation. This type of car is used in law enforcement and military engagements for some the reasons like Hazard exposure which is controlled from a location of 
relative safety. Such  vehicles are  used by many  police department  bomb squads to  defuse or detonate explosives. These  vehicles  are  also  used  in  space  exploration,  by  using  such  vehicle  NASA.  ESA  and ROSCOSMOS have explored and collected many data from space, the moon, and mars. In recent days giant companies are using remote control vehicles to deliver their products. And many of the giant factories have their transportation which is remotely controlled. 
Here  we  have  connected  this  4-wheeler  with  Arduino  and  Bluetooth  Module/  There  is  an Android application that is already installed in the remote device. We send our instruction to the vehicle  with  that  application,  that  application  is  connected  with  the  module  in  the  vehicle. 
Bluetooth module transfer that instruction as a signal to the  Arduino, and Arduino works with that signal.  In the  Arduino, we  have installed the code which  can work  with the signals and convert those instructions to the pre-defined signals. Signals were transferred to the motors, and the car started running.  
This  car  does  not  have  advanced  features  but  we  can  attach  any  kind  of  features  like  line detecting, or obstacle detecting, even though we can attach the camera to the vehicle and watch it with the remote. This one is just a basic prototype of a remote-control car, we can add a lot of advanced features and get an armed/especially capable RC Car. 
This project aimed to design an automated vehicle prototype built with Arduino and controlled with software developed on  Android that  can perform  manual or  automatic paths.  Until now research and analyzing the simulation of experiments shown, it is believed that it is feasible touse the prototype designed for cognitive development, for future users can learn to insert custom paths that can process  logic issues and more  complex mathematics  allowing the  prototype to perform the desired movements. Analyzing the financial costs of design, it is believed that it is feasible to construct this type of prototype because it presents a low cost of the components used, particularly if they are chosen in a largescale production. It is worth noting that both the Arduino programming language and  the language  for Arduino  in development  are free, not  burdening 
additional costs for the development of the project, pointing out that this applies also to the tools used for development. 


Methodology 
Tools:  
● Chassis (Including motors and wheels):  
The main body of the car consists of the chassis. Alongside there will be four motors for 
the four wheels which will lead down the car.
ARDUINO UNO

● Arduino Uno:  

The  Arduino  Uno  is  an  open-source  microcontroller  board  based  on  the  Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino. cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins that may be interfaced with various expansion 
boards  and  other circuits.

L293D Motor Drive H-Shield:  
  L293D Motor Drive H-Shield:  
The Motor Driver is a  module for motors that allows you to control the working speed and  direction  of  two  motors  simultaneously.  This  Motor  Driver  is  designed  and developed based on L293D IC. L293D is a 16 Pin Motor Driver IC. This is designed to provide bidirectional drive currents at voltages from 5 V to 36 V. Rotation of  a motor depends on the enabled pins.

Jumper Wires:
Jumper Wires: 
A jump wire (also known as jumper, jumper wire, DuPont wire) is an electrical wire, or group of them in a cable, with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them components, without soldering.

Battery:           
● Battery:  
A  battery  is  an  energy  source  consisting  of  one  or  more  electrochemical  cells  and terminals on both ends called an anode (-) and a cathode (+). Here for the project, a 9V battery has been used.

Bluetooth Module:

Bluetooth Module:  
In figure 7 HC-05 6 Pin Wireless Serial Bluetooth Module is a Bluetooth module for use with any microcontroller.  It uses the UART protocol to make it easy to send and receive data  wirelessly.  The  HC-06  module  is  a  slave-only  device.    This  means  that  it  can connect to most phones and computers using Bluetooth technology.
